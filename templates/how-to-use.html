<h1 style="padding-top:0px;">The goal of Synja.</h1>
<p>The syntax of a programming language describes which words and sentences are part of the language. The goal of synja is to improve the understanding of the user for the syntax of Java.</p>

<h1 style="padding-top:0px;">The teaching methods of Synja.</h1>
<p>The course is divided into lessons which are devived into small units. I will explain one, after another and test your knowledge. If you don't understand my explanation, i can express myself in a different way. At the end of a lesson is a bigger test. The lessons are: programm structure, basics, operators, controll structures, methods, arrays and classes. I can show you the information in different forms: in a text, a picture or in a more active way. I'll check you in several ways: using multiple choice quizzes, gaps and code tasks.</p>

<h1 style="padding-top:0px;">The UI of Synja.</h1>
<p>The UI consists of three parts: the pedagogical agent layer, the input layer, and the teaching layer. At the dialog level the conversation with Synja is displayed. At the input layer the user can answer related to the dialog (left) or related to a task (right). At the pedagogical agent level (on the right) you can see a graphical representation of Synja.</p>
